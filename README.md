A simple little app that lets people doing forum or chat moderation on website to assemble messages from blocks the put in to make form messages faster to customise.

## FAQ

#### Can I categorise the blocks?

Nope, I'm afraid I wouldn't know where to start for that. However you can get similar behaviour if you preface a note's title with your category. It will sort by that so in theory you just do something like "Category - Title" in the title.

#### Can delete the placeholder?
Well... yes but it will just build a new one. There must always be one.

#### How do I get started?
You can get started by hitting "Edit Components" on the main screen and then creating new blocks. As mentioned above you don't need to delete the placeholders. Just make a new block for each section. Greeting, Rule, Citation and Signoff. You can have more of course and that's the reason the program exists.

#### Why are there two checkboxes on the main screen?
They let you have a random greeting or random signoff. Obviously rules and citations shouldn't be randomised :)
